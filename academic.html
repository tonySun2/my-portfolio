            I entered UCLA as an Economics major after earning first place in the 2020 International Economics Olympiad China Final in high school. 
            Through conversations with my math and economics professors, 
            I realized early in my undergraduate studies that achieving my high school dream of becoming an economist 
            required a stronger foundation in mathematics and statistics, 
            so I switched to a double major in Mathematics/Economics and Statistics & Data Science.

            Gradually, I found myself drawn more to finance, where outcomes are objectively measured by profits and losses. 
            I am particularly interested in quantitative finance, 
            a field that merges financial analysis with advanced statistical and computational techniques. 
            To meet the challenges of this rigorous field, I continuously refine my technical skills and expand my knowledge base through these

            My most recent internship was at Equitable in New York, 
            where I focused on using data science tools to improve workflow efficiency. 
            I developed a dashboard to track the evolution of key parameters
            —such as book value and option-adjusted spread—for the company’s $6 billion portfolio in asset-backed securities. 
            Using Bloomberg Python API, I fully automated the market data watchlist update process, 
            reducing manual effort and enabling real-time data access. 
            This experience reinforced my interest in applying data-driven solutions to investment.
