        <h1>Academic and Professional Background</h1>
        <p>
            I entered the <strong>University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)</strong> as an Economics major after earning first place in the 
            <strong>2020 International Economics Olympiad China Final</strong> in high school. Early in my undergraduate studies, I realized that achieving 
            my high school dream of becoming an economist required a stronger foundation in mathematics and statistics. This realization led me to transition 
            to a double major in <strong>Mathematics/Economics</strong> and <strong>Statistics & Data Science</strong>, both of which have significantly 
            broadened my analytical perspective.
        </p>
        <p>
            While I initially enjoyed the theoretical aspects of economics, I became increasingly drawn to finance, where outcomes can be objectively measured by profits and losses. 
            Over time, my interests evolved toward <strong>quantitative finance</strong>, a discipline that merges financial analysis with advanced mathematical and statistical techniques. 
            It is a highly competitive field, attracting some of the brightest minds, and I am motivated to contribute meaningfully to it.
        </p>
        <p>
            To meet the challenges of this rigorous field, I continuously refine my technical skills and expand my knowledge base through 
            <a href="coursework.html">coursework</a> and <a href="projects.html">projects</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Research & Work Experience</h2>
        <p>
            My academic journey has been complemented by hands-on research and professional experience that have honed my problem-solving and computational skills.
