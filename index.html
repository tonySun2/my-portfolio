        <h1>Hi, my name is 孙文宏 (romanized: Wenhong Sun).</h1>
        <p>In English-speaking environments, I often go by <strong>Tony Sun</strong>, a name I like and find easy to connect with others.</p>
        
        <h2>Academic and Professional Background</h2>
        <p>
            I entered the <strong>University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)</strong> as an Economics major after earning first place in the 
            <strong>2020 International Economics Olympiad China Final</strong> in high school. Early in my undergraduate studies, I realized that achieving 
            my high school dream of becoming an economist required a stronger foundation in mathematics and statistics. This led me to switch to a double major 
            in <strong>Mathematics/Economics</strong> and <strong>Statistics & Data Science</strong>, fields that have significantly broadened my analytical perspective.
        </p>
        <p>
            While I initially enjoyed the theoretical aspects of economics, I found myself drawn to finance, where outcomes can be objectively measured by profits and losses. 
            Over time, my interests shifted toward <strong>quantitative finance</strong>, a field that merges financial analysis with advanced mathematical and statistical techniques. 
            It’s an extremely competitive discipline, attracting some of the brightest minds, and I’m motivated to contribute meaningfully to it. To meet the challenges of this rigorous 
            field, I continuously refine my technical skills and expand my knowledge base with these

        <h2>Personal Background</h2>
        <p>
            I grew up in <strong>Chengdu, China</strong>, a city famous for its rich history. The city itself dates back to <strong>367 BC</strong>, and my high school recently celebrated 
            its <strong>2,160th anniversary</strong>, having been founded in <strong>141 BC</strong>. Chengdu is also home to the world-famous <strong>Panda Research Center</strong>, 
            where hundreds of pandas are cared for, and its <strong>hotpot</strong> is a must-try culinary experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of academics, I’m a die-hard <strong>Chelsea Football Club</strong> fan—a passion that started in 2014 when I visited <strong>Stamford Bridge</strong> for the first time. 
            While my childhood dream was to become a football commentator, I’ve long accepted that I’m better at watching football than playing it. However, I do have a knack for <strong>tennis</strong>, 
            a sport I’ve been playing since I was nine. Since moving to the U.S. for college, I’ve also developed a love for <strong>hockey</strong> and now closely follow the NHL.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond sports, I’m an avid <strong>movie enthusiast</strong>, particularly drawn to the works of <strong>Denis Villeneuve</strong> and <strong>Christopher Nolan</strong>. 
            I also have a passion for <strong>photography</strong>—while I used to bring my <strong>Fujifilm XPro3</strong> on every trip, I’ve recently embraced the convenience of phone photography, 
            carrying my camera less often but still capturing moments wherever I go.
