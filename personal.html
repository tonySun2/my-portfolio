        <p>
            I grew up in <strong>Chengdu, China</strong>, a city deeply rooted in history and culture. Chengdu itself dates back to <strong>367 BC</strong>, and my high school 
            recently celebrated its <strong>2,160th anniversary</strong>, having been founded in <strong>141 BC</strong>. The city is home to the world-famous 
            <strong>Panda Research Center</strong>, where conservation efforts protect and study giant pandas. Chengdu is also renowned for its vibrant culinary scene, 
            particularly its <strong>hotpot</strong>, a must-try for any visitor.

        <h2>Sports & Hobbies</h2>
        <p>
            I am a lifelong football fan and have supported <strong>Chelsea Football Club</strong> since 2014, when I had the unforgettable experience of visiting 
            <strong>Stamford Bridge</strong>. Though my childhood dream was to become a football commentator, I have since accepted that I am better at watching football than playing it. 
            That said, I have been playing <strong>tennis</strong> since I was nine and continue to enjoy it as a favorite pastime. Since moving to the U.S. for college, 
            I have also developed a deep appreciation for <strong>hockey</strong> and now closely follow the NHL.
        </p>

        <h2>Film & Photography</h2>
        <p>
            I am an avid <strong>film enthusiast</strong>, particularly drawn to the works of 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denis_Villeneuve">Denis Villeneuve</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Nolan">Christopher Nolan</a>. 
            Their ability to blend compelling narratives with visually stunning cinematography is something I deeply admire.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to film, I have a passion for <strong>photography</strong>. While I used to bring my <strong>Fujifilm XPro3</strong> on every trip, 
            I have recently embraced the convenience of mobile photography, capturing meaningful moments wherever I go.
        </p>

        <h2>Curiosity & Learning</h2>
        <p>
            My curiosity extends beyond finance and technology. I enjoy exploring diverse topics, including <strong>history, geopolitics, and space exploration</strong>. 
            I find great joy in discussing thought-provoking ideas, whether they relate to financial markets, artificial intelligence, or global affairs.
